# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Roudoku application to ensure data protection, user privacy, and system integrity.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

#### Firebase Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Anonymous authentication with upgrade path
- Social login integration (Google, Twitter)
- JWT token validation with expiration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

#### API Security
- Bearer token authentication
- Request rate limiting per user/endpoint
- IP-based blocking for malicious actors
- Session management with secure cookies

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization

#### Comprehensive Input Validation
```go
// All user inputs are validated and sanitized
result, err := securityService.ValidateAndSanitizeInput(ctx, input, "text")
```

#### Protection Against:
- SQL Injection attacks
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Path traversal attacks
- Command injection
- File upload vulnerabilities

#### Validation Rules:
- Email format validation with regex
- URL scheme validation (https/http only)
- Filename sanitization (no dangerous characters)
- Text length limits and encoding validation

### 3. Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection

#### Multi-Level Rate Limiting
- Global rate limits: 10,000 requests/minute
- User-specific limits: Variable by endpoint
- IP-based blocking for repeated violations
- Circuit breaker pattern for service protection

#### Endpoint-Specific Limits:
- Authentication: 2 RPS, 5 burst
- Recommendations: 10 RPS, 20 burst
- Search: 15 RPS, 30 burst
- Books: 20 RPS, 40 burst

### 4. Data Encryption

#### Encryption at Rest
- AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
- Encrypted database connections (SSL/TLS)
- Secure key management with rotation

#### Encryption in Transit
- HTTPS enforcement (TLS 1.3)
- Certificate pinning for mobile apps
- Secure WebSocket connections

```go
// Example: Encrypting sensitive user data
encrypted, err := securityService.EncryptSensitiveData(personalInfo)
```

### 5. Security Headers

#### Comprehensive Security Headers
```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://apis.google.com
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

### 6. Database Security

#### PostgreSQL Security Measures
- Connection pooling with encryption
- Prepared statements (no dynamic SQL)
- Row-level security policies
- Regular security audits and updates

#### Firestore Security Rules
- Granular access control per collection
- User-based data isolation
- Admin-only access for sensitive data
- Rate limiting in security rules

### 7. API Security Best Practices

#### Request Validation
- Maximum request size limits (10MB)
- Request timeout protection (30 seconds)
- JSON schema validation
- Content-Type validation

#### Response Security
- No sensitive data in error messages
- Consistent error response format
- Information disclosure prevention

### 8. Mobile App Security

#### Client-Side Protection
- Certificate pinning
- Root/jailbreak detection
- Anti-debugging measures
- Secure storage for sensitive data

#### Network Security
- TLS certificate validation
- Request/response encryption
- Offline data protection

## Security Monitoring & Incident Response

### 1. Security Event Logging

All security-relevant events are logged with the following information:
- Timestamp and duration
- Client IP and User-Agent
- Request method and path
- Security analysis results
- Response status codes

### 2. Threat Detection

#### Automated Detection
- Abnormal traffic patterns
- Failed authentication attempts
- Suspicious input patterns
- IP reputation scoring

#### Alert Thresholds
- More than 10 failed logins/hour per IP
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS attack patterns
- Unusual API usage patterns

### 3. Incident Response

#### Response Levels
1. **Low**: Log and monitor
2. **Medium**: Rate limit user/IP
3. **High**: Block user/IP immediately
4. **Critical**: System-wide protection mode

// Firestore security rules enforce data access policies
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // User data access control
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
                            request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```
